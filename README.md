Planetside2 Killboard
=====================

This is a simple [Overwolf](http://www.overwolf.com/) overlay that will display the real-time killboard of a player. It has two modes, a full mode that will display some player info as well as a nicely formatted table. In the lite mode the killboard will show a basic UI that can be placed on a corner of the screen so it does not interrupt the gameplay.

Settings
--------
I have also added some buttons and sliders so the user can configure the rate at which the data is retrieved. The user can also select if the kill/deaths events will trigger a screenshot. 

Non-overwolf usage
------------------
The Overwolf API is used to toggle betwen lite and full mode and for taking the snapshots. The page can still run on a normal browser, it will just not take screenshots.
